# Course Introduction

As a discipline, statistics has given profound tools to the sciences.
Statistics is our way of detecting patterns in the noisy universe.
Traditionally, psychologists were limited to research questions that
could be answered with classical statistical analyses, but without
particularly intending to do so, psychologists have found themselves at
the cutting age of statistical discovery in the 20th and 21st centuries.
This is because we needed to adapt our tools to meet the demands of the
complex nature of the phenomena we study. This course will give you the
quantitative tools to ask and answer research questions that were
impossible to test as recently as a decade ago. Specifically, we will
cover the following topics as stand-alone modules:

1.  Multilevel modeling
2.  Missing Data
3.  Non-Gaussian statistics: logistic regression, poisson regression,
    ordinal regression, multinomial regression, beta regression
4.  Beyond Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST): Structural
    equation models, Bayesian hypothesis testing
5.  Process models: Mediation, multiple mediation, path analysis
6.  Dimension reduction: Factor analysis

I place a strong emphasis on practical application. I believe you are
more likely to learn and readily use these analyses in the future if you
do them at least once now. Every lecture will have "challenge"
demonstrations for you to try the analyses along with me. Every
Wednesday there will be a lab going over the material covered that week.
The lab assignments will help you build a personal library of example
statistical scripts that you will hopefully find useful for years into
the future. These lab assignments will be due at the end of class.

# Audience

This course is designed for quantitative psychologists but it is
relevant to any social and natural scientists studying human behavior.

# Prerequisite

The main prerequisite for this course is PSY 503.

**NOTE:** It is highly recommended (but not mandatory) that students
also enroll in *PSY 505: Advanced Seminar in Statistical Methods and
Research Practices in Psychology* (Spring 2024, T: 11am - 1pm), which
constitutes an important complement to this course.

# Student Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course, students will be able to:

-   Make informed analytic decisions

-   Run and code analyses in R

-   Interpret output and summarize results of the analyses

-   Effectively communicate results from statistical analyses to a
    general audience

-   Use Quarto to write reproducible reports and GitHub for version
    control and collaboration

# Office Hours

I will hold weekly office hours (M: 1-3 P.M.; W: 1-2 P.M.). If you need
to see me outside of these hours please schedule a meeting:
https://calendly.com/jg9120/30min

# Textbooks

-   I strongly recommend you get the following books:

    -   Xing Liu (2023). Categorical Data Analysis and Multilevel
        Modeling Using R (1st edition). SAGE Publications Ltd.

        ::: callout-note
        -   I will post PDFs for these chapters so you do not need to
            buy them, but these are really nice books to have (they are
            pretty cheap).

# Attendance Policy

You're expected to come to class prepared!

Attendance and participation are *crucial* to your success in this
course. If you are sick or are incapable of participating meaningfully
in class (e.g., you have stayed up all night and are going to fall
asleep in class), please stay home. I will try my best to record
in-class (or record them at home) so you do not miss any content.

# Absences and Late Work

If you need to be absent or submit an assignment late, please let me
know as soon as possible. We don't need to know your personal or medical
details. We can be flexible, but please respect my time by turning your
assignments in on time whenever possible.

# Technology

It is expected that you will bring your laptop to class. Please try to
keep it class related.

# Assignments

::: callout-important
The default grade is an ‚ÄúA,‚Äù and the vast majority of students will make
an ‚ÄúA.‚Äù If you are particularly engaged with the class either during
lecture or outside of class, do all your labs (and revise them in
accordance with my feedback) and submit one of the best final project
papers, then you will get an A+. If you do a substandard job on your
labs (e.g., not submitting or doing really poorly on a number of labs),
then you could make an A- or lower. Or, if you submit an abysmally bad
final paper, then you can make an A- or lower. If you are at risk for
making less than an A- in the course (i.e., a B+ or lower) due to lab
submissions, then we will let you know before the last date you can
cancel the class. In terms of your GPA, getting an A or A+ does not
matter. This marking scheme is purposefully non-quantitative so that you
will focus on learning instead of on your marks. Basically, you will
make an A unless you slack off and do not care about the training you
are receiving through this class. There is a big difference between
‚Äúslacking off‚Äù and being overwhelmed, though. Please reach out to me if
you feel overwhelmed.

## Readings

Every week there will be assigned readings. You will be expected to read
the weekly readings before class, so you can come prepared to class for
student-lead presentations. There are also readings for after class that
will aid in the lab portion of the class on Wednesdays.

## Student mini-lectures and discussions

Every week (Monday) one of your peers will present an introduction to
the method we will be discussing that week, based on the assigned
reading for that week (you are to use the assigned articles to guide
your presentation and discussion). Each presentation should be be (\~20
minutes).

After, I will take over and highlight how to use R to apply these
methods to your data.

In these presentations, I would like:

-   A clear overview of the topic: This should include a brief
    introduction to the topic, highlighting its relevance and importance
    in psychological research. You should also address limitations, if
    any.

-   Examples and applications: To help peers' understand the practical
    implications of the topic, you should provide examples and
    applications of how the topic is used in psychology. This could
    include your own research or examples from the literature. If you
    wanted to walk through an example, that is also welcome.

-   A discussion of things you did not understand or you had general
    questions about.

## Labs/Exercises

-   Each week (Wednesday) we will have one corresponding lab exercise
    that will be started in class. The purpose is for you to get direct
    experience conducting the analyses that you learn. Each lab exercise
    will consist of several questions and will require R (will also
    accept Python) to answer the questions in a reproducible manner. All
    lab assignments must be reproducible (i.e., I can replicate the work
    you did without any errors). You may complete the labs by yourself
    or working with another person. If you work with another person,
    your work must obviously be your own.

Ideally, you will finish labs in class. However, if you choose to finish
at home, completed labs will be due at 11:59 p.m. on the Sunday of that
week. Please let me know if you need an extension. I WILL NOT ACCEPT
LABS MORE THAN A WEEK LATE.

## Tutorial

For your final project, you will create a tutorial explaining how to run
a particular analysis in R or Python. This will involve finding data or
using your own data. The final project gives you a chance to pursue a
specific method discussed in class and apply it to your own data.

There are a tone of great blog posts out there to serve as your muse!

## Final Exam

**There is no final exam üòä**

## Participation

It is expected that you will come to class having read the articles
assigned and prepared to discuss the material.

# Grades

At the end of the semester, you will assign yourself the final grade.
You will provide a self-evaluation as whether you met the learning
outcomes for the course and how well you think you did on assignments
and the final project. I have veto rights to change your assigned grade
:).
