## Labs

-   Every week (Wednesday) we will have a lab activity covering material from that week

    -   Lab should be completed in QMD and rendered as HTML document (needs to be **reproducible!**)

        -   Have until Sunday at midnight to turn them in

-   I will provide feedback and comments that you should incorporate into a revision

::: callout-note
I will not accept labs more than a week late!

## Tutorial/blog post

-   The final project will require you to use one of the methods discussed in class to analyze data (your own or publicly available data) and write a short blog post walking us through the process (i.e., pre-processing, analysis, and interpretation of results)

    ::: callout-note
    -   **Will go over how to create Quarto blog/website on Wednesday**
