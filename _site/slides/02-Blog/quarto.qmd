## Writing Your Own Posts

I recommend learning to blog with quarto by opening and modifying the
template files.

You can see all of the files in your project by clicking on the files
tab:

![](writing_own.png){fig-align="center"}

## New Post

-   To create a new post, copy an existing folder and name it something
    else

    ![](new_post.png)

## Index

-   Clicking on "index.qmd" should open the file in the R studio text
    editor (on the left)

-   Give it a new name and delete the default text

## Re-render

# You have made your first blog!

## Share it on Github

1.  Open up Github Desktop

2.  Go to preferences and sign in to your Github.com account

3.  "Add" your blog project folder to Github Desktop

4.  Publish to github.com and uncheck private repository (if you want
    other people to see it.)

5.  You should now be able to see your new repository in your github.com
    profile, which means you should be able to see a copy of your blog
    files in the repository.

## QMD Changes for Github Site

-   To change the output directory from `_site` to `docs` open up
    `_quarto.yml`, and add the line `output-dir: docs` just like this:

<!-- -->

```         
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```

-   Should see a new docs folder

-   Push your changes to github so that your repository, and activate
    the github pages option under your repository settings.
